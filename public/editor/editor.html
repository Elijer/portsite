<!-- 

1. Make an entry and an outry div and put the cursor in the middle.
As you move the cursor, just move stuff from entry to outry.

2. Move the cursor around inside of an existing div. This isn't working great...
not sure why really. I'm gonna mess around with it a bit more though first.

3. Create some sort of absolute thing, and then just make the cursor the only thing
visibile. There are so many helpful parts about this. Keeping it in sync is the only
problem. But honestly it wouldn't be that hard, right?

IMPORTANT NOTES

1. Umm I have a class called .noselect, which makes it impossible to select stuff.
Wouldn't be surprised if that's causing problems.

2. A span has to have an an span: </span> and I'm pretty sure I didn't include
one before.
