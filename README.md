# portsite

I was building a nice simple vanilla JS portfolio website when I got side-tracked by the prospect of my dream note-taking webapp, which allows you to use hotkey commands to rapidly format text. I'll make a separate repo for it soon.

My idea was to easily style text in exciting, visually informative ways with easy-to-use hotkeys. I noticed that it can be a bit laborious to style things. Markdown was an epiphany for me. However, as robust as markdown is, it still needs to be rendered. So I created a more casual experience inspired by Markdown.
